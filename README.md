## Using the Application
After starting up the application the user is asked rather the fighter will be a computer controlled AI,their is a limit, or a human. This last until done is typed into the terminal.

When the battle begins each AI randomly chooses an attack option given to them based on rage and health and human users pick which option they want.

If the battle has more than two fighters the human user pick who they want to attack(if that is the option they chose) and the AI randomly chooses someone.

When health is zero the fighter is taken out of the arena and no longer has a turn. The battle last as long as more than one person is alive.
